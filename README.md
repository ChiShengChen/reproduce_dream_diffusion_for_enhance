## [on-going]  
In this repository I reproduced Dream Diffusion paper in local ubuntu environment, try to pre-trained EEG representation and use author checkpoints to generate images.  

### paper:  https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16934  
### official code:  https://github.com/bbaaii/DreamDiffusion  

- [x] pretraining on EEG data
- [ ] fineture the stable diffusion with pre-trained fMRI Encoder
- [ ] Generating Images with Trained Checkpoints
